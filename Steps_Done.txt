Data Preprocessing

Set the 'Date' column as the index and drop irrelevant columns like 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Volume', 'Change%'.
Plot the closing price for visualization and explore the data's statistical properties.
Check stationarity through rolling statistics and the Dickey-Fuller test.


Time Series Analysis
Visualize rolling statistics.
Conduct Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity.
Perform differencing to achieve stationarity if needed.
Decompose the time series into trend, seasonality, and residuals.


Model Building and Forecasting
Fit an ARIMA model to the training data.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like RMSE, MAPE, ME, and MAE.
Visualize the forecasts against actual data.


Additional Models and Comparison
Implement and evaluate other models like Simple Exponential Smoothing, Holt Method, and Holt-Winter Method.
Compare model performance using RMSE, MAPE, ME, and MAE metrics.
Present the results in tabular format for easy comparison.


Forecasting Beyond Available Data
Forecast stock prices for a specified future date range using the final ARIMA model.
Update the dataframe with forecasted values and visualize the forecasted period against the original data.
